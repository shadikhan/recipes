Classic Sandwich: 2 slices cheddar, monterey jack or Swiss cheese between 2 slices country white bread; cook, flipping once, until golden.

How to make grilled cheese:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon salted butter in a cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.

2. Press the sandwich slightly and place it in the skillet. Cook until golden on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes.

3. Flip, adding more butter to the pan if needed, and cook until the other side is golden and the cheese melts, 3 to 5 more minutes.
